# Down the Stack

A layered map of computer science, from the tools you use (Kafka, Spark, Delta, Pinot, Postgres, Kubernetes, LLMs, GPUs) down through systems patterns, core techniques, CS foundations and mathematics to first principles in physics, biology and philosophy.

Every concept has a read with the same shape:

- **Why it exists**: the value this layer adds
- **How it works**: the mechanism, and how the layers below make it possible
- **What it stands on**: generated from the graph, one line per lower-layer idea
- **Why it makes sense**: the intuition
- **Where it still hurts**: the friction that remains
- **Go deeper**: papers, books, articles, courses and docs

Long "deep reads" (about 10 minutes) add **How we got here** and **In practice**.

## Run it

```bash
./run.sh            # builds data/content.db, then serves http://localhost:8787
./run.sh 9000       # another port
```

Needs only Python 3.9+ (standard library: `http.server`, `sqlite3` with FTS5). No packages to install.

## What is where

```
content/graph/        nodes*.txt, edges*.txt, tours.txt      the graph (plain text, easy to diff)
content/reads/        *.txt                                   one read per concept (and L0..L5 layer essays)
content/reads/long/   *.txt                                   long reads: "@@ id" replaces, "@@+ id" extends
tools/kg.py           parser + validator (every node has a read, every edge has a reason, every node reaches L5)
tools/build.py        content -> data/content.db (SQLite + FTS5) and dist/down-the-stack.html (single shareable file)
server/server.py      local API + static web server (Python standard library only)
web/                  the app (index.html, app.css, app.js); works against the API or with embedded data
tests/                test_api.py (unittest), e2e.js (Playwright browser test)
data/                 content.db (rebuilt) and user.db (your progress, bookmarks, notes; never rebuilt)
```

## API

| Method | Path | What |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/graph` | all concepts (summary), links, tours, layers, stats |
| GET | `/api/read/<id>` | full read for a concept or layer essay (`L0`..`L5`) |
| GET | `/api/search?q=` | full-text search over every read (FTS5, BM25; phrase hits first) |
| GET | `/api/library` | every source, grouped by work, with the concepts that cite it |
| GET | `/api/me` | your progress, bookmarks, notes counts, reading time |
| PUT/DELETE | `/api/progress/<id>` | `{"status":"read"|"reading"}` |
| PUT/DELETE | `/api/bookmarks/<id>` | save / unsave |
| GET/POST/PUT/DELETE | `/api/notes` | your notes per concept |
| POST | `/api/time/<id>` | add reading time (capped per call) |
| GET | `/api/export` | download all your data as JSON |

The server binds to 127.0.0.1, rejects unexpected `Host` headers (DNS rebinding) and requires `application/json` for writes (so other websites cannot post to it).

## Editing content

Add a concept: a line in `content/graph/nodes_*.txt` under its layer, edges in `edges_*.txt` with a reason for each link, and a read in `content/reads/`. Then `python3 tools/build.py --check` tells you exactly what is missing (no read, no sources, no path down to L5, an edge pointing upward...).

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v          # API
node tests/e2e.js http://localhost:8787/          # browser (needs Playwright)
```
